integration.py — Drop-in helpers that plug HGNN into the existing pipeline
===========================================================================
Three functions:

  1. enhance_event_confidences(events, all_road_names)
     → Adjusts every event's confidence score using full city-wide graph context.
       Multi-source corroboration, spatial clustering, source reliability all
       influence the adjustment. Safe fallback if HGNN unavailable.

  2. score_route_with_hgnn(route_data, events)
     → Runs HGNN on ONLY the events relevant to this specific route.
       Returns a route-specific score [0, 10] that differs across routes.
       This is what makes Route 1 score differently from Route 3.

  3. get_cascade_road_names(route_road_names, all_events)
     → Uses HGNN road-near-road probabilities to find roads NOT on the route
       but likely to be affected due to spatial cascade (e.g. Howrah Bridge
       blocked → Strand Road congested even without explicit event for it).
       Returns expanded road list for broader event matching.

Blending strategy for confidence:
  final_conf = (1 - W_HGNN) × rule_based_conf + W_HGNN × hgnn_conf
  W_HGNN = 0.25 — enough to move scores meaningfully without overriding LLM

    Route 1 with 4 disruptions scores differently from Route 3 with 8.
